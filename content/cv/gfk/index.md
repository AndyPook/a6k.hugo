Scans sources for pricing information. Data is normalised, translated, aggregated into data stores with api’s and a web ui. Clients can then track actual selling prices of their products or competitor pricing policies.

Processing via a messaging platform. Migration to dotnet Core, Linux containers, Kubernetes, Kafka. I worked across the system. Also created frameworks to ease creation of services and api’s, applying standards and cross cutting concerns.
