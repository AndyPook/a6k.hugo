Accounting and Tax services for the self-employed.

Adding features for identifying fees for Channel Partners.
System is self hosted with dotnet for UI, APIs and message bus.

Currently built with .Net Framework. I built packages in netstandard and net6 to replace/modernise parts of the platform while keeping a level of source code compatibility to make migration possible.
