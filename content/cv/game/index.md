  text: Andy worked on the PIM workstream of my Digital Transformation Programme. Within days of Andy joining the team it was clear that he is very technically competent and highly experienced. It wasn't long before the other developers in the PIM team started going to Andy for help/advice/guidance so that he became seen as the senior developer on the team. I would recommend Andy to any team that needs a very capable senior developer with his skill set.
