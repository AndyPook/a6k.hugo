testimonial:
  name: Ian Turner
  role: Technical Director
  text: Andy is an incredibly gifted developer / architect, and really strong thought-leader. His was the stand-out response to a post we put out for a senior .NET developer, and he led some really complex work-streams for me over the course of a year and more. Like any of the best developers, Andy constantly pushed and challenged the team to up their game. And had a real knack for quickly finding his feet with the latest and greatest technologies and trends. For a senior developer, solution architect, or team leader role, it is very easy to recommend Andy
