Develop a new web based application to support the running and management of veterinary practices. The current system has reached its scaling limit and a new system is required to support business growth.

Written from the ground up with a micro-services style in C# with dotnet 5.0 in the backend to support Angular with ngRx in the browser. Using SignalR (websockets) as the primary "api" transport and a message bus to provide a scalable, realtime feel to the app.

I also built the devops pipelines to build, test and compile into docker containers using Helm to deploy to k8s clusters.
